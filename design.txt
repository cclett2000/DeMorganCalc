Task: Calculate DeMorgan's Law

    DEFS:
        - Intersection: contains all elements of set1 that are also in set2
        - Union: set of all elements in both sets

    - Calc (A U B)′ -- all numbers not in union set
            A′ ∩ B′ -- compute not, then do intersection

- Read in sets from file
- calculate union and compare against number universe
- then calculate number universe by
